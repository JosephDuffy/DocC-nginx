# DocC-nginx

The docker container used to host [docc-nginx.josephduffy.co.uk](https://docc-nginx.josephduffy.co.uk/).

It serves as an example of how to host a DocC archive using nginx.

The website hosts the documentation for [VaporDocC](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/VaporDocC), which is Vapor middleware that serves files from a DocC archive.

The configuration – along with examples for Netlify, Vapor, and Apache – are discussed further on my blog:
